I haave to developed a management system utilizing the Spring framework with Spring Data JPA and an H2 database to perform CRUD operations.
This system enables Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for managing data effectively.
With Spring's dependency injection, Spring Data JPA's repository support, and H2's lightweight and fast database capabilities, your system efficiently handles HTTP requests for 
adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. 
This integrated solution simplifies development and ensures seamless interaction with the database, making it ideal for various applications requiring robust data management.
